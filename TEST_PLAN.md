## Test Implementation

### Tools & Framework
- Jest for unit and integration tests
- Supertest for API testing
- MongoDB Memory Server for database tests
- Mock Service Worker for external API mocking

### Test Structure

```

### Running Tests
```bash
# Run all tests
npm test

# Run specific test suites
npm run test:unit
npm run test:integration
npm run test:e2e

# Run with coverage
npm run test:coverage
```

## Test Data Management

### Test Fixtures
- Sample products data
- User profiles
- Order scenarios
- Meal plan templates

### Database Strategy
- Use MongoDB Memory Server for isolation
- Reset database between tests
- Seed required data in beforeEach hooks

## CI/CD Integration

### GitHub Actions Workflow
```yaml
name: Test Suite
on: [push, pull_request]
jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2
      - name: Install dependencies
        run: npm install
      - name: Run tests
        run: npm test
      - name: Upload coverage
        uses: codecov/codecov-action@v2
```
